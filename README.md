# Frontend Dollmaker Script

This repository contains a fully frontend-based dollmaker implementation. It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON files for part configuration. No backend or server-side processing is required.

## Features

- **Frontend-only operation**
  All rendering, layering, and UI interactions happen directly in the browser.

- **Part configuration via JSON**
  Image paths and category information are managed through JSON files, making it easy to add, remove, or modify parts.

- **Sample part images included**
  The demo images included in this repository were created by me, but I do not claim copyright. You are free to use or modify them however you like.

## Notes

Unlike the legendary backend-based dollmaker scripts that used full drag-and-drop for adding parts, this frontend version works slightly differently:

- Parts are **added to the build area by clicking** on an item in the drawer.
- Once added, parts **can be moved freely by dragging** within the build area.

This approach keeps the UI simple while still allowing flexible placement.

## Purpose

This project was created to modernize an older dollmaker script that originally relied on backend processing. My goal was to provide a version that works entirely on static hosting environments, in case it helps others who want to build or customize their own dollmaker tools.

## Future Updates

This is an initial release, and improvements or adjustments may be added over time.
